        <h1>Why do some people give up and others don't?</h1>
        <p>Every entrepreneur has failed. Even I have, even though I am very young (16) and barely an entrepreneur. I've struggled with over seven businesses that I gave up on. But why did I?</p>
        <p>I failed six businesses. At my young age, this is a lot. But why did I? What made me give up, even though I watched a lot of motivational videos on Instagram which all conveyed the same message: "do not give up"</p>
        <p>What was wrong with me back then? And what did I improve in my mindset to now be one hundred percent sure that I'll never give up on any business again?</p>
        <p>I'll tell you honestly… If you give up on a project and don't start another one, you don't really want to succeed. And if you give up on a project and start another, it only delays your success.</p>
        <p>I'll share my personal experience for both situations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first Twitter accounts and the businesses affiliated with them were a total failure. Not because of the content, but because my vision for these projects was awful. I truly thought it was a total waste of time. Why? My account, like almost every account that has ever existed on X, was stagnating.</p>
        <p>I thought this was a sign that my content was not worth continuing. So I gave up miserably and let other people succeed while I was wasting my life on random things. If I had kept working on my first account, I would have by far passed 20k followers on X (this was 3–4 years ago).</p>
        <p>My mistake was concluding that my project would never gain followers because of stagnation. Back then, I didn't realize that <strong>every successful entrepreneur has experienced stagnation</strong>—often much worse than mine. For example, MrBeast waited four years before getting his first 1,000 followers on YouTube, with more than 250 videos published.</p>
        <p>He was 13 and never gave up. Look where he is now. I don't need to tell you how successful he has become.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last Twitter account was given up because of a technical issue. I couldn't manage to reactivate it, and without waiting, I rushed to create another account. I'm confident that I'll succeed, but I lost a lot of time by abandoning the first one. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been avoided by being more serious and preventing all sorts of issues that make you lose time or money.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, failing is what makes you learn. But what truly brings learning and success is not giving up. Be serious and disciplined. Even though you may think your project is a waste of time, either you convince yourself that this is how every business starts, or you immediately start another business after giving up. And don't forget: the important thing is not the destination, but the journey itself.</p>
